# WebscrapingDiscordBot
A webscraping Discord bot that can be customized. For the example I used the word of the day site from www.dictionary.com. Every time a new word of the day is added to the site, it will send a Discord webhook like the one below. 

If you would like help customizing this please send me a message on Discord - xStar#6070
